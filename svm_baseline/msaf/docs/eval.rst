Evaluations
===========

MSAF includes the standard evaluation metrics used in `MIREX <http://www.music-ir.org/mirex/wiki/2016:Structural_Segmentation>`_. Here we describe how to evaluate the algorithms' results and discuss each of these metrics, classified based on the subtask they aim to assess.

These metrics are computed using the external and fantastic framework `mir_eval <https://github.com/craffel/mir_eval>`_.

How To Evaluate Results
-----------------------

The module `eval.py <https://github.com/urinieto/msaf/blob/main/msaf/eval.py>`_ contains the following ``process`` function that can be called once the desired algorithms have been run on a single file or dataset:

.. automodule:: msaf.eval

The return value of this function is a dictionary (or a list of dictionaries, in case of *collection mode*) containing all of the available metrics for the evaluated subtask(s).
The keys to this dictionary, with a description of each metric are found below.
